# Basic_Responsive_Website_With_Html
, the website is divided into different sections: header, navbar, content, and footer. The CSS styles define the layout and responsiveness of each section.
The .container class sets a maximum width for the page content and centers it on the page. The .header, .navbar, .content, and .footer classes define the styles for each section.
The @media rule with the max-width media query adjusts the layout when the screen width is 600 pixels or less. In this case, the navbar links are stacked vertically instead of being displayed side by side.
You can run this HTML code in a web browser to see the responsive behavior. Try resizing the browser window or viewing the page on different devices to observe how the layout adapts.
Note that this example only demonstrates the basic structure and responsiveness of a website layout. For a complete and functional responsive website, you would need to include more content, design elements, and possibly use frameworks like Bootstrap or CSS Grid for more advanced responsive features.
